## Purpose 

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive page that will allow users to easily sift through bellybutton diversity data. We created three different visuals on our webpage (a bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart) as well as a panel that displays demogrpahic info for each test subject id number selected.
